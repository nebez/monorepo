# List all dependencies between projects.
# Poject is identified with relative path to project's root directory from repository root.
# Dependencies are based on Gradle's `composite build` feature (https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html).
# Dependency is defined by using `includeBuild` function in project build script.
#
# Outputs lines of tuples in format PROJECT1 PROJECT2 (separated by space),
# where PROJECT1 depends on PROJECT2.

# Usage:
#   list-dependencies.sh
